# homework18-WorkoutTracker

This fitness tracking app was developed primarily with MongoDB and Heroku. Navigating to the home page lands a user on their dashboard, where they can choose to add new workout data to the database, or continue a previously logged workout. 

## User Story
As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

## The app should meet the following
* Add exercises to the most recent workout plan.
* Add new exercises to a new workout plan.
* View the combined weight of multiple exercises from the past seven workouts on the "stats" page.
* Vew the total duration of each workout from the past seven workouts on the "stats" page.
